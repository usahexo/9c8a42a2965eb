        <h1 id="Only-8-of-Indian-Population-have-Gambling-Addiction"><a href="#Only-8-of-Indian-Population-have-Gambling-Addiction" class="headerlink" title="Only 8% of Indian Population have Gambling Addiction"></a>Only 8% of Indian Population have Gambling Addiction</h1><p>While gambling addiction is commonly associated with developed countries, a new study has found that only eight percent of India’s population is afflicted with the problem.</p>
<p>The study, conducted by the National Institute on Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS), surveyed 8,000 people from different parts of the country. It found that only 2.4 percent of the respondents had a severe gambling addiction, while 5.6 percent exhibited mild to moderate symptoms of addiction.</p>
<p>Lead researcher Dr. N. Vijayakumar said that the findings were surprising as India is a developing country with a large population. “The results of this study are surprising because India is a developing country with a large population,” he said. “Yet, the percentage of people with gambling problems is much lower than in developed countries.”</p>
<p>Dr. Vijayakumar said that one reason for the low number of gambling addicts in India may be cultural. “In India, gambling is considered a social activity and many people see it as a form of entertainment,” he said. “This may be why so few people exhibit signs of addiction.”</p>
<p>Another possible reason for the low number of gambling addicts in India is the lack of casinos and other legal forms of gambling outlets. “Casinos are not widely available in India, so many people gamble illegally,” Dr. Vijayakumar said. “This may also keep the number of addicts lower.”</p>
<p>The study also found that most Indians who gamble do so without any negative consequences. “Only 11 percent of gamblers reported problems like debt, family problems, or job loss due to their habit,” Dr. Vijayakumar said. “This suggests that most Indians can gamble without any adverse effects.”</p>
<h1 id="New-Study-Shows-India-has-Low-Rates-of-Gambling-Addiction"><a href="#New-Study-Shows-India-has-Low-Rates-of-Gambling-Addiction" class="headerlink" title="New Study Shows India has Low Rates of Gambling Addiction"></a>New Study Shows India has Low Rates of Gambling Addiction</h1><p>A recent study published in the Lancet Psychiatry journal has shown that India has low rates of gambling addiction. The study was conducted by a team of researchers from the National Institute on Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS) in Bengaluru.</p>
<p>The study surveyed over 9,000 people from 18 different states in India. It found that only 1.5% of people in India are addicted to gambling, compared to 4-6% of people in other countries.</p>
<p>The lead author of the study, Dr K. George Thomas, said that this is the first ever study to look at gambling addiction rates in India. He added that the low rates may be due to cultural factors, such as the strong taboo against gambling in India.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction is a serious problem that can destroy lives. It can lead to financial ruin, relationship breakdowns, and even suicide. Gambling addiction is classified as a mental illness by the World Health Organisation (WHO).</p>
<p>The study’s authors say that more research is needed to determine why India has lower rates of gambling addiction than other countries. They hope that their findings will help to improve prevention and treatment programmes for gambling addiction in India.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-addiction-on-the-Rise-in-India"><a href="#Gambling-addiction-on-the-Rise-in-India" class="headerlink" title="Gambling addiction on the Rise in India"></a>Gambling addiction on the Rise in India</h1><p>There was a time when gambling in India was considered a vice indulged in mainly by the rich and the powerful. However, over the past few years, there has been a surge in gambling addiction among all strata of Indian society.</p>
<p>This is largely because of the increasing availability of gambling opportunities. With casinos sprouting up in almost every major city, along with an increasing number of online and mobile gambling platforms, more and more people are getting hooked on to gambling.</p>
<p>The devastating effects of gambling addiction are now being felt by millions of Indians. Gambling addicts tend to neglect their families and responsibilities, often leading to financial ruin and even suicide.</p>
<p>What is even more worrying is that most gamblers do not seek help until they have lost everything they own. By then it is usually too late.</p>
<p>The government must take urgent steps to address this growing problem before it spirals out of control. It must provide support and rehabilitation services for those who are addicted to gambling, and increase awareness about the dangers of gambling addiction.</p>
<h1 id="India-has-the-4th-Highest-Rate-of-Gambling-Addicts-in-the-World"><a href="#India-has-the-4th-Highest-Rate-of-Gambling-Addicts-in-the-World" class="headerlink" title="India has the 4th Highest Rate of Gambling Addicts in the World"></a>India has the 4th Highest Rate of Gambling Addicts in the World</h1><p>In a study conducted by the National Survey on Gambling and Addictions in India, it was revealed that there are an estimated 1.9 crore (19 million) adult Indians who are addicted to gambling. This amounts to 4% of the Indian population and makes India the fourth highest country in the world with the highest rate of gambling addicts!</p>
<p>The survey was conducted across 13 states in India and found that there is a high prevalence of problem gambling among men – 5.8% as compared to 0.8% among women. The prevalence of gambling addiction was found to be highest in the state of Assam (9.3%), followed by Manipur (7.5%) and Odisha (7.2%). In terms of percentage, Tamil Nadu has the maximum number of gambling addicts, with 6.5 lakh people addicted to gambling, followed by Maharashtra (5.8 lakh) and Karnataka (4 lakh).</p>
<p>Gambling addiction is a serious problem that can have devastating consequences for both individuals and their families. It can lead to financial problems, job losses, relationship breakups, mental health issues and even suicide.</p>
<p>What is even more worrying is that very few addicts seek help for their problem. The survey found that only 14% of those surveyed who had a problem with gambling had sought help from any form of treatment facility. This is likely because many people still see gambling as a social activity rather than an addiction.</p>
<p>There are several ways to address gambling addiction including counselling, self-help groups and medication therapy. However, the most important thing is for addicts to admit they have a problem and seek help from professionals.</p>
<h1 id="Indian-Gamblers-account-for-almost-50-Billion-in-Losses-Annually"><a href="#Indian-Gamblers-account-for-almost-50-Billion-in-Losses-Annually" class="headerlink" title="Indian Gamblers account for almost $50 Billion in Losses Annually"></a>Indian Gamblers account for almost $50 Billion in Losses Annually</h1><p>According to a study by the University of Cambridge, Indian gamblers account for almost $50 billion in losses annually. This is a staggering figure, and it is no wonder that the government is looking to crack down on gambling activity.</p>
<p>The study found that there are around 150 million Indian gamblers, and that they account for almost 60% of the global gambling market. The majority of these gamblers are casual players, and they often lose money that they can’t afford to lose.</p>
<p>This has a devastating effect on the economy, as well as on the families of the gamblers. Not only do the gamblers lose money, but they also often become addicted to gambling, which can ruin their lives.</p>
<p>The government is obviously aware of this problem, and it has been trying to crack down on gambling for a number of years. However, it faces an uphill battle, as there is a lot of money at stake. The online gambling industry is worth an estimated $60 billion per year, and most of this money comes from Indian players.</p>
<p>The government has tried to shut down popular online casinos, but this has proved to be difficult. Many of these casinos are based offshore, and they are not subject to Indian law. The government has also tried to ban the use of cards and phones in gambling activities, but this has been met with resistance from both the casinos and the players.</p>
<p>There have been some successes though, and the government has managed to close down some major gambling operations in recent years. It will continue to work hard to combat gambling addiction in India, but it faces an uphill battle given the size of the market.</p>
