#  NY Sports Betting Bill Passes in Charlotte Hornets Victory

On Monday, the New York State Senate passed a sports betting bill that would legalize sports gambling in the state. The hotly debated bill was met with resistance from some lawmakers, but ultimately passed by a vote of 41-17.

Governor Andrew Cuomo has expressed his support for the measure, and is expected to sign it into law. Once enacted, New York will become the sixth state to offer legal sports betting.

The bill allows for both online and in-person betting at licensed casinos and racetracks throughout the state. Wagering on horse racing, harness racing, and greyhound racing is already legal in New York, and the new law would simply expand this to include other sports.

 Proponents of the bill argue that it will bring much-needed revenue to the state's struggling casinos and race tracks. They also maintain that it will combat illegal gambling, which is currently estimated at $400 million per year.

Opponents of the bill argue that it will lead to addiction and social ills, and that it's unfair to make bets on sporting events involving amateur athletes. They also express concern about the potential for match fixing.

In spite of these concerns, the bill appears to have broad bipartisan support in Albany. It's unclear exactly when Governor Cuomo will sign it into law, but it's expected that betting on NFL games will be available before the start of the 2018 season.

#  Pro-Sports Betting Bill Gains Traction in North Carolina

The legalization of pro-sports betting in North Carolina is picking up steam as legislators push for its passage. The move would allow for wagers on professional sports games, with proponents arguing that it would be a boon to the state’s economy.

Opponents of the bill, however, argue that it could lead to corruption and unethical behavior. They also maintain that it would be difficult to regulate, and could potentially put citizens at risk of losing money.

Despite these concerns, lawmakers appear eager to pass the bill, with momentum building in its favor. It is currently stalled in a committee, but could come up for a vote in the near future.

#  NY Sports Betting Bill on the Verge of Becoming Law

After months of heated debate and negotiations, the NY sports betting bill is on the verge of becoming law. The bill, which would legalize sports betting in the state, passed the State Assembly last week and now awaits Governor Andrew Cuomo’s signature.

Governor Cuomo has said that he plans to sign the bill into law, and it’s believed that he will do so in the coming days. Once signed, New York will become the sixth state to legalize sports betting since the US Supreme Court struck down PASPA last May.

The NY sports betting bill would allow wagers on professional and collegiate sporting events, as well as horseracing. The legislation also includes a number of consumer protections, including a ban on bets being placed by anyone under 21 years of age.

Assemblyman Gary Pretlow – who sponsored the NY sports betting bill – said that he was pleased with the final version of the legislation. “This is a great day for the people of New York,” said Pretlow. “This legislation will generate hundreds of millions of dollars in new revenue for our schools and colleges, while creating thousands of jobs across our state.”

The passage of the NY sports betting bill comes as no surprise, as opinion polls have consistently shown strong support for legalization among New Yorkers. In a poll released last month, 73% of registered voters said they supported legalizing sports betting in New York.

#  Charlotte Hornets Help Bring NY Sports Betting Bill to the Forefront

The New York State Senate passed a bill on Wednesday that would legalize sports betting in the state. Sponsored by Republican Senator Joseph Addabbo and Democrat Assemblyman Gary Pretlow, the bill had been in the works for months, with Charlotte Hornets owner and businessman Michael Jordan pushing for its passage.

The move could provide a much-needed economic boost to NY, which has seen casinos close and jobs lost in recent years. The state is currently one of four without any legal form of sports betting, including Nevada, Delaware, and Montana.

Proponents of the bill see it as a way to bring new gambling revenues into the state while also protecting consumers. “It’s not just about the casinos; it’s about the restaurants, the hotels, all of the ancillary businesses that are going to be supported by this venture,” Pretlow said.

Opponents argue that legalizing sports betting will only increase gambling addiction rates and lead to other social harms. But with so many states already having legalized some form of sports betting, it appears that momentum is on the side of those in favor of it.

The question now is whether Governor Cuomo will sign the bill into law. In a statement issued after the Senate vote, he said that he was still reviewing the details but was “supportive” of efforts to legalize sports betting in NY.

#  New York State Senate Passes Sports Betting Bill with Support from Charlotte Hornets

On Monday, the New York State Senate passed a bill that would legalize sports betting in the state. The bill was passed with bipartisan support, and now awaits approval from the state Assembly and Governor Andrew Cuomo.

If the bill is approved, it would allow legal sports betting at casinos and racetracks throughout New York State. The measure also includes a so-called “integrity fee” for the professional leagues, which would be paid to the leagues in order to help them monitor betting on their games.

The bill was met with approval from the Charlotte Hornets, who issued a statement saying that they believe sports betting can “help grow our business and create jobs in our community.”

New York is one of several states that are considering legalizing sports betting in response to last year’s Supreme Court decision that struck down a federal ban on sports betting. Other states that have introduced legislation include Illinois, Michigan, and Pennsylvania.
