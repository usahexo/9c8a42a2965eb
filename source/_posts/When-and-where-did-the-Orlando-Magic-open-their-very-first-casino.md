#  When and where did the Orlando Magic open their very first casino?

The Orlando Magic casino, located in Florida, first opened its doors to the public in April of 2001. The casino was a major project for the Magic organization at the time, costing $265 million to construct. It was also the largest gambling venue in the Southeast United States.

The casino consisted of a 122,000 square foot gaming floor with 2,500 slots and video poker machines, 74 table games, and a 16-table poker room. There was also a large sports book, restaurants, bars, and a 300-room hotel.

Due to its size and location, the Orlando Magic casino quickly became a popular destination for tourists and locals alike. In its first year of operation, it generated over $515 million in revenue and employed over 1,600 people.

Despite its initial success, the Orlando Magic casino has had its share of financial troubles over the years. In 2006, it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after raking up more than $1 billion in debt. It emerged from bankruptcy several months later after being acquired by Harrah's Entertainment.
