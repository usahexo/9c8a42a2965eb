# How to Deal 21 Blackjack: A Guide by Thackeray

Blackjack, also known as 21, is one of the most popular casino games in the world. It is a game of chance that requires a mix of skill and luck to win. One of the critical components of the game is dealing the cards. In this guide, we will go over how to deal 21 blackjack according to Thackeray.

## The Rules of Blackjack

Before we dive into how to deal blackjack, let's review the rules of the game. In blackjack, the goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. Each player is dealt two cards, and they have the option to "hit" and receive additional cards or "stand" and keep their current hand. The dealer also receives two cards, but one card is face down.

The value of the cards in blackjack is as follows:

- Ace: 1 or 11
- 2-10: face value
- Jack, Queen, King: 10

If a player's hand exceeds 21, they lose the game. If the dealer's hand exceeds 21, the player wins the game. If both the player and dealer have hands that are less than or equal to 21, the one with the highest hand value wins.

## Dealing Blackjack According to Thackeray

Now that we understand the rules let's discuss how to deal blackjack according to Thackeray.

1. Shuffle the deck: Before dealing, the deck should be shuffled to ensure that the cards are randomized.

2. Place the bets: Each player places their bet before the cards are dealt.

3. Deal the cards: Starting with the player to the left of the dealer, deal one card face up to each player, including the dealer. Then deal a second card, but this time, deal it face down to each player and one face up to the dealer.

4. Play the hand: The player to the left of the dealer starts the game by deciding whether to hit or stand. The player can continue to hit until they are satisfied with their hand, or they exceed 21. Once the player is satisfied with their hand, play moves to the next player.

5. Dealer's turn: Once all players have played their hands, it's time for the dealer to play their hand. The dealer reveals their face-down card and decides whether to hit or stand based on the value of their hand. The dealer must hit if their hand is less than 17 and must stand if their hand is 17 or more.

6. Determine the winner: Once the dealer has played their hand, the winner is determined by comparing the player's and dealer's hand values. If the player's hand is higher than the dealer's hand, the player wins. If the dealer's hand is higher than the player's hand, the dealer wins. If both hands are equal, it's a tie.

## Conclusion

Dealing blackjack according to Thackeray is a straightforward process that can be easily learned with practice. Remember to shuffle the deck before dealing, place the bets, deal the cards, play the hand, let the dealer play their hand, and determine the winner. With these simple steps, you can enjoy the game of blackjack and increase your chances of winning.
