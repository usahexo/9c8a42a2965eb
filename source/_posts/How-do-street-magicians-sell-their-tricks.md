Street magicians are always looking for new ways to sell their tricks. And, with the advent of the internet, they have a new way to do just that.

There are a number of ways that street magicians can sell their tricks online. One way is to create a video explaining how the trick is done and post it on YouTube. Another way is to create an instructional PDF or e-book that explains the trick in detail.

 Street magicians can also sell their tricks through online magic shops. These shops often carry a wide selection of magic tricks, including those used by street magicians. They also offer a variety of payment options, including credit cards and PayPal.

Another way for street magicians to sell their tricks is to create a website or blog where they can offer tips on how to learn magic, as well as showcase their own tricks. This not only allows street magicians to share their tricks with others, but it also helps them build a following and attract new customers.
