#  Need help choosing the right dungeons for Challenging Roulette? Look no further! 

The Dungeons of Challenging Roulette are a major draw for new and veteran players alike. As we all know, the key to a successful run is selecting the right dungeon! So, how do you determine which dungeons are right for your party?

There are several important factors to consider when choosing a dungeon. The first is the party’s level. It’s important to choose a dungeon that is at or below the party’s level. This will ensure that the enemies within the dungeon are not too difficult and that the party can complete the dungeon quickly.

Another important factor is the party’s composition. Some dungeons are better suited for certain party compositions than others. For example, the Tower of Flames is well-suited for parties with multiple tanks, while the Forest of Shadows is well-suited for parties with high damage output.

The third factor to consider is whether your party is looking for a challenge or not. Some dungeons, like the Tower of Despair, offer more of a challenge than others. If your party is looking for a greater challenge, then you should consider opting for more difficult dungeons. However, if your party would rather avoid too much difficulty, you should stick to easier dungeons.

The final factor to consider when choosing a dungeon is its rewards. Different dungeons offer different rewards upon completion, so it’s important to choose one that offers rewards that your party needs or desires. The Forest of Shadows, for example, offers rewards that are perfect for parties seeking to increase their Damage Output stat.

Now that you know what factors to consider when choosing a dungeon, let’s take a look at some specific examples! 

If your party’s level is below 10: 
The Crystal Caves: This dungeon is ideal for low-level players as it features enemies that are around level 5 or 6. Additionally, it offers great rewards upon completion including gems and experience points. 
The Gold Mine: This beginner-friendly dungeon also features enemies around level 5 or 6 and offers great rewards upon completion including gold and experience points. 

If your party’s level is between 10 and 20: 
The Tower of Flames: This dungeon is ideal for players in the 10-20 range as it features enemies around level 13 or 14. Additionally, it offers great rewards upon completion including gear and experience points. 
The Tower of Despair: This more challenging dungeon is perfect for players in the 10-20 range as it features enemies around level 16 or 17. Additionally, it offers great rewards upon completion including gems and experience points.

#  Dungeon tips for beating the Challenging Roulette! 

<!-- more -->

If you're looking to beat the Challenging Roulette and get some of the best rewards in the game, look no further! I'm here to give you some tips on how to make it through those notoriously challenging dungeons.

Firstly, it's important that you have a strong party formation. You'll want a healer, a tank, and damage dealers. If you don't have these specific classes in your party, your run will likely end in failure.

Secondly, make sure you are well-equipped. The better your gear, the easier the dungeon will be. Try to focus onstat boosting items rather than sheer damage output.

Finally, use your consumables wisely. Potions and scrolls can make all the difference when it comes to defeating difficult bosses. Make sure you save them for when they're needed most!

#  How to make the most of your Challenging Roulette runs! 

In roulette, there are occasions when you will have what seems like an especially bad run of results. The key to making the most of these challenging runs is to remember that they are a natural part of the game, and not to overreact to them. Here are a few tips for getting through difficult periods:

- Stay calm and rational. When you're on a losing streak, it can be easy to start making rash decisions based on your emotions. This can lead to bigger losses and more frustration. Instead, try to stay calm and logical, making decisions that are rational and in line with your long-term goals.

- Don't bet more than you can afford to lose. One of the biggest mistakes that people make when they're on a losing streak is betting more money than they can afford to lose. This only makes things worse, as you're risking more money in the hopes of recouping your losses faster. It's much better to bet responsibly and within your means, even if it means taking longer to recover your losses.

- Stick to your game plan. If you have a game plan that has been working for you, don't abandon it just because you're on a losing streak. There is no magic solution that will instantly turn things around; the best way to deal with a tough run is usually to stick to what you know works and be patient.

- Don't get discouraged. Losing streaks are frustrating, but it's important not to let them discourage you from playing roulette in the future. The reality is that streaks like this are a normal part of any game, and they will eventually end. So keep your head up and continue playing confidently; sooner or later the momentum will shift in your favor again.

#  Get a leg up on the competition with our dungeon cheat sheet for the Challenging Roulette event!

The Challenging Roulette event is a new dungeon that has just been added to Dragalia Lost and it is kicking off the game's second half of life. This dungeon is important not only because it drops some of the best gear in the game, but also because it provides players with the opportunity to snag some very rare items.

In this article, we will provide you with a cheat sheet for completing the dungeon as quickly as possible. So without further ado, let's get started!

### The Basics

The Challenging Roulette event dungeon is made up of six floors, each with its own set of challenges. In order to complete the dungeon as quickly as possible, you will need to be familiar with both the enemies and the floor layouts.

In terms of enemies, you will want to focus on building a team that can deal with both single and group targets. For floor layouts, you will want to focus on speed over damage; most floors can be completed relatively easily as long as you move quickly between encounters.

That said, there are a few things worth noting about each floor:

-Floor 1: This floor can be completed relatively easily using a team of two aerial units and one water unit. The key here is to take out the enemy minions quickly so that they don't block your path; using AoE skills is ideal for this.

-Floor 2: This floor can be completed fairly easily using a team of two melee units and one ranged unit. The key here is to use your ranged unit to take out the skeleton mages from a distance; if they start attacking your melee units, they will likely die very quickly.

-Floor 3: This floor can be completed relatively easily using a team of three water units. The key here is to use your water units to take out both the turrets and the enemies at the same time; if you leave the turrets alive they will do a lot of damage to your team. Alternatively, you can use a team of two water units and one melee unit if you are confident in your ability to take out the turrets quickly.

-Floor 4: This floor can be completed relatively easily using a team of three melee units. The key here is to use your melee units to take out both the mages and the enemy minions at the same time; if you leave the mages alive they will do a lot of damage to your team. Alternatively, you can use a team of two melee units and one ranged unit if you are confident in your ability to take out the mages quickly.

-Floor 5: This floor can be completed relatively easily using a team of two ranged units and one magic unit. The key here is to use your magic unit to take out both sets of turrets from afar; if you leave either set alive they will do a lot of damage to your team. Alternatively, you can use a team of two ranged units and one melee unit if you are confident in your ability to take out turrets quickly.
I - Floor 6: This floor is by far the most difficult in the dungeon; it is recommended that only high-level players attempt it. The key here is to focus on taking out enemies quickly while avoiding taking too much damage yourself; using AoE skills is ideal for this purpose.
