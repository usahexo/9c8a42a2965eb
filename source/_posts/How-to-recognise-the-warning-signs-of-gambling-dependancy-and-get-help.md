#  How to recognise the warning signs of gambling dependancy and get help

Gambling can be a fun and thrilling experience, but for some it can quickly become an addiction. If you or someone you know is exhibiting the warning signs of gambling addiction, it’s important to get help as soon as possible.

One of the key warning signs of gambling addiction is when someone starts gambling more frequently or spending more money than they can afford. Other red flags to look out for include feeling the need to gamble more and more in order to get the same high, chasing losses, lying about how much money has been gambled, and neglecting important responsibilities due to gambling.

If you think you may have a gambling addiction, there are many resources available to help you get treatment. Talk to your doctor or contact a local addiction hotline for advice on where to find help. There is also a wealth of information online, including websites specifically dedicated to helping people overcome gambling addiction.

Getting help for a gambling problem is crucial; not only for the individual suffering from addiction but also for their loved ones. With timely treatment and support, gambling addiction can be overcome and life can return to normal.

#  How to break the habit and overcome gambling dependancy

If you're having trouble overcoming a gambling dependancy, you're not alone. Gambling addiction is a real problem, and it can be tough to break the habit. But it's not impossible. Here are a few tips to help you get started.

1. Seek professional help.

This is probably the most important step. If you're struggling to overcome your addiction on your own, seeking professional help can make all the difference. There are many qualified professionals who can help you get on the road to recovery.

2. Be honest with yourself.

The first step in overcoming any addiction is admitting that you have a problem. Be honest with yourself about how much you gamble and how it's affecting your life. Only by acknowledging the issue can you begin to address it.

3. Make a plan.

Once you've acknowledged the problem, it's time to make a plan for dealing with it. This might include things like setting limits on how much money you can spend at casinos or cutting back on other expenses so you have less money to gamble with.

4. Stay motivated.

Overcoming an addiction is not easy, and there will be times when you feel like giving up. It's important to stay motivated and focused on your goal of breaking free from gambling addiction. Find someone who can support you through this process, whether it's a friend, family member or professional therapist.

#  How to deal with the guilt and shame of being a gambler

Guilt and shame are common emotions for problem gamblers. They can feel like they're doing something wrong and that they're a bad person. This often keeps people from seeking help, or from talking about their gambling problems.

But it's important to remember that guilt and shame are not rational emotions. They don't reflect reality. Gambling is not a moral issue - it's a health issue. And there is nothing wrong with seeking help for a health issue.

If you're struggling with guilt and shame, here are some things that might help:

1. Acknowledge your feelings. Don't try to fight them or ignore them. Just let yourself feel them.

2. Remind yourself that guilt and shame are not rational emotions. There is nothing wrong with you as a person because you have a gambling problem.

3. Talk to someone about your feelings - either a friend or family member, or a therapist. Talking openly and honestly can be really helpful in coping with guilt and shame.

4. Seek out support groups for problem gamblers. These groups can offer understanding and support, which can be very helpful in dealing with guilt and shame.

5. Get professional help for your gambling addiction. Professional treatment can address the underlying causes of your guilt and shame, and can help you overcome these feelings.

#  How to keep gambling under control and protect yourself from addiction

When it comes to gambling, there are a lot of risks that come with it. Unfortunately, for some people, the appeal of gambling can be too strong and they can quickly become addicted. However, there are ways that you can keep gambling under control and protect yourself from addiction. Here are a few tips:

1. Only gamble what you can afford to lose

One of the best ways to keep gambling under control is to only gamble what you can afford to lose. If you have money saved up for emergencies or for other discretionary expenses, then you can use that money to gamble without putting yourself in any danger of becoming addicted. However, if you start borrowing or using money that you don’t have in order to gamble, then that is when things can start to get out of control.

2. Set limits on how much time you spend gambling

Another way to keep gambling under control is to set limits on how much time you spend gambling. This means setting a limit on the number of hours per day or week that you will gamble. If you find yourself getting close to your limit, then stop and take a break until the following day or week. This will help to prevent you from spending too much time gambling and developing an addiction.

3. Don’t chase your losses

One of the biggest dangers of gambling is chasing your losses. When you are losing money at the casino or betting on sports, it can be tempting to bet even more in order to try and win back what you have lost. However, this is a recipe for disaster as it often leads to even bigger losses. In fact, most people who develop a gambling addiction do so because they kept chasing their losses. So, instead of trying to win back your losses, walk away and come back another time when you are not feeling as emotional about the game or casino table.

4. Avoid temptation by staying away from casinos and online betting sites

The best way to protect yourself from developing a gambling addiction is by avoiding temptation altogether. This means staying away from casinos and online betting sites altogether. If these places are not in easy reach then it will be less likely for you to give in and gamble. Instead, find other ways to entertain yourself such as hobbies or spending time with friends and family.

#  How to find support if you are struggling with gambling dependancy

Gambling addiction is a real issue that a lot of people struggle with. If you are finding it difficult to stop gambling, there are many different types of support available to you. This article will discuss some of the options available to you.

One option for seeking help is attending a meeting of Gamblers Anonymous (GA). GA is a 12-step program that can help you overcome your addiction to gambling. The meetings offer support and advice from people who have been through the same struggles as you.

Another option for getting help is therapy. You can find therapists who specialize in gambling addiction, or who have experience working with addicts in general. Therapy can provide you with support and guidance as you work to overcome your addiction.

If you feel like you need more intense treatment than what is offered by therapy or GA, there are also outpatient or inpatient rehab programs available that can provide intensive treatment for gambling addiction. Outpatient rehab allows you to continue living at home while receiving treatment, while inpatient rehab requires that you live at the rehab facility during treatment.

 whichever option you choose, it is important to get help if you are struggling with gambling addiction. The people and resources mentioned in this article are just a few of the many available to you. Getting help is the first step on the road to overcoming your addiction and restoring your life.
