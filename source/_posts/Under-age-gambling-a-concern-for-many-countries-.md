#  Under-age gambling a concern for many countries 

Governments around the world are becoming increasingly worried about the number of young people gambling, as this could lead to long-term problems for them.

Gambling addiction can have serious consequences for young people, including psychiatric disorders, financial problems, and even suicide. In some cases, children as young as seven are being treated for gambling addiction in hospitals.

A number of measures have been introduced in an effort to curb gambling by youths. In Singapore, for example, it is illegal for anyone under the age of 21 to gamble. In Australia, setting up a betting account requires participants to be at least 18 years old.

However, despite such measures, many youngsters continue to gamble. This is often due to the ease with which they can access online casinos and sports betting websites.

It is clear that more needs to be done to protect children from the dangers of gambling. Governments and gaming providers must work together to make it more difficult for youngsters to gamble, and also educate them about the risks associated with excessive gambling.

#  Netherlands proposes lower gambling age to 18 years old 

 Amidst the rising concerns on gambling addiction, the Dutch government has decided to propose a lower gambling age from 18 to 16 years old.

The proposal was announced by Interior Minister Ronald Plasterk on Monday, who said that it is better to allow young people to gamble at a younger age in a controlled environment.

Plasterk cited the recent example of the state-owned Holland Casino, which lowered its entrance age from 21 to 18 years old last year. The number of visits by those aged 18 to 21 increased by 50 percent, while the number of problem gamblers remained stable.

“Young people make their first experiences with gambling in a responsible way in casinos that are specifically tailored to them,” Plasterk said in a statement. “This gives them time to grow into adulthood without developing a gambling addiction.”

The new proposal will have to be approved by parliament before it can be implemented.

#  Australia may lower gambling age to 18 in response to UK proposal 

The Australian government is considering a proposal to lower the gambling age from 21 to 18 in response to a similar proposal announced by the UK government last week.

The move would allow young people aged 18 and over to gamble in casinos, online and at racetracks.

It is argued that the proposal would create jobs in the gambling industry, with proceeds being funnelled into worthwhile causes such as education and infrastructure.

Critics of the proposal argue that it could lead to increased rates of addiction and problem gambling among young people. They also claim that the money generated by gambling would not be funneled into beneficial causes, but would instead line the pockets of casino owners and operators.

#  Spain ready to debate casino gambling age at 17 after UK move 

Spain is now ready to debate a casino gambling age of 17 after the United Kingdom made the move to lower its age from 18. 

According to a report from Europa Press, the General Directorate for Gaming Regulation (Dirección General de Regulación de Juegos) has confirmed that it is studying the possibility of lowering the age limit for casino gambling in the country to 17 years old. The change would be in line with recommendations from the World Health Organization (WHO), which state that people should begin gambling at an early age in order to protect them from problem gambling. 

Previously, Spain’s age limit for casino gambling was 21 years old, but it was lowered to 18 in 2015 following a recommendation from the European Union. However, it seems that Spain may be ready to go even further and lower the age limit to 17. 

This news comes as a bit of a surprise since Spanish lawmakers have been reluctant to make any changes to the country’s gambling laws in recent years. In fact, there have been several attempts by opposition lawmakers to introduce new legislation that would crackdown on online gaming and poker operators in Spain, but none of these bills have been successful so far. 

Nevertheless, it appears that the government is now open to debating a change in the age limit for casino gambling and a final decision could be made later this year.

#  USA could see change in gambling age as states look to compete

A recent study by the University of Nevada, Reno has shown that there is a correlation between a decrease in the gambling age and an increase in state revenue. The study, which was funded by the American Gaming Association, found that as other states have lowered their gambling age, revenues from gambling have increased. This has prompted several states, including Illinois and Michigan, to consider lowering their gambling age to 18.

While it is still too early to say definitively whether or not a decrease in the gambling age would be beneficial for states, the study’s findings could play a role in changing how Americans think about gambling. Currently, the legal gambling age is 21 in most states, but there has been a steady movement towards lowering this age in recent years.

Arkansas was the first state to lower its gambling age to 18 in 2001. In the years since then, 10 other states have followed suit. In total, there are now 18 states where the legal gambling age is 18 or younger.

So why are more and more states considering lowering their gambling age? According to experts, there are a few reasons.

First, technology has made it easier for young people to gamble. With online casinos and sports betting platforms readily available, it is easier than ever for minors to place bets.

Second, young people are increasingly seen as a major source of revenue for casino operators. There is evidence that younger generations are more likely to gamble than older generations and they are also more likely to spend more money when they do gamble.

Finally, many lawmakers believe that young people should be able to gamble at an earlier age if they are going to do so anyway. By regulating and taxing gambling at an earlier age, lawmakers can ensure that any potential risks associated with gambling are mitigated as much as possible.



So far, there has been no major opposition to efforts to lower the gambling age in the United States. However, some experts have raised concerns about potential negative consequences of dropping the legal gambling age too low.

One concern is that young people may not be mature enough to gamble responsibly. Another concern is that underage gamblers may be more likely to develop addiction problems than adults. Finally, some experts worry that younger gamblers may not have access to reliable information about responsible gaming practices.
