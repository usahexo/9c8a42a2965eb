#  Desert Diamond Casino Goes Up For Sale – Local Businesses Worry About The Impact

The Desert Diamond Casino has announced that it is going up for sale. The casino, which is located in Tucson, Arizona, is one of the state’s largest, and it employs more than 1,000 people.

Many local businesses are worried about the impact that the sale will have on them. The casino is a major employer in the area, and it has been a driving force behind the local economy for many years.

Some business owners are concerned that the new owner may decide to close the casino down. This would be a devastating blow to the local community and to the thousands of people who rely on the casino for their livelihood.

Others are worried that the new owner may decide to move the casino elsewhere. This could cause major job losses in Tucson and would have a negative impact on the local economy.

The Desert Diamond Casino has been a fixture in Tucson for many years, and its sale is sure to cause a lot of upheaval in the community. Local business owners hope that the new owner will be someone who cares about the well-being of Tucson and who will continue to operate the casino in a responsible manner.

#  Desert Diamond Casino To Remain Closed Indefinitely

The Desert Diamond Casino in Tuscon will remain closed indefinitely due to a wave of recent robberies.

This was announced by the casino's general manager, who said that the closure is necessary to ensure the safety of employees and guests.

This is not the first time that the casino has been forced to close its doors due to security concerns. It was also shut down in early 2017 after employees were targeted in a series of robberies.

Local law enforcement officials have said that they are working closely with the casino to investigate the recent spate of robberies and to find those responsible.

In a statement, the casino said that it hopes to reopen as soon as possible but it cannot provide any further information at this time.

#  Desert Diamond Casino In Turmoil As Workers Strike

The Desert Diamond Casino in Tucson, Arizona is in the midst of a worker's strike as employees demand better pay and benefits. The casino has been open for business for more than two years, but the workers have yet to see any progress in their negotiations with management.

The workers are asking for a pay raise that would bring their salaries up to at least $15 an hour, as well as better health insurance and retirement benefits. So far, the casino has refused to meet these demands, and the workers have decided to take action.

In a statement released last week, the workers' union said that they are "ready and willing to do whatever it takes to win a fair contract." They added that they hope the casino will come to the bargaining table ready to negotiate "in good faith."

So far, the casino has not shown any indication that it plans to give in to the workers' demands. In a statement released last week, management said that it is "committed to reaching an agreement that is fair and equitable for all of our team members." It also said that it has already offered "a competitive wage and benefit package" to the workers.

The workers say that this package is not good enough, and they are prepared to go on strike until their demands are met. It remains to be seen how long the strike will last and how much impact it will have on the casino's business.

#  Who Will Own Desert Diamond Casino Now?

The Tucson-based Desert Diamond Casino is up for sale, but who will end up owning it?

The casino was put up for sale in February by owner DDC Casino Management LLC. The company is a subsidiary of the Tohono O'odham Nation, which operates the casino.

According to reports, the tribe is looking to sell the casino because it doesn't want to be in the casino business. It's been looking for a buyer since last year.

So far, there hasn't been any interest in buying the casino. This is likely because of the state of the gaming industry and the fact that the casino is located on tribal land.

There are a few potential buyers that could be interested in the casino, including other tribes and private equity firms. However, it's unclear if any of these groups will make an offer for the property.

If no one buys the casino, it's likely that the tribe will keep it and operate it themselves. This would be a big change for the tribe, which has never operated a casino before.

It will be interesting to see what happens with Desert Diamond Casino and who ends up owning it.

#  What's Next For Desert Diamond Casino?

No one knows quite yet what's next for the Desert Diamond Casino.

What we do know is that the casino has been sold to the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community.

The sale price was not disclosed, but it's thought to be in the $170 million range.

According to a press release from the tribe, they plan on operating the casino "in a similar fashion" as Desert Diamond Casino Tucson.

It's not yet clear if any changes will be made to staff, hours of operation, or casino floor layout.
