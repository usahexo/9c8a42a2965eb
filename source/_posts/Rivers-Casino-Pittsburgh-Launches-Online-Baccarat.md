#  Rivers Casino Pittsburgh Launches Online Baccarat

Rivers Casino Pittsburgh has just announced the launch of its new online baccarat game, which is now available to players within the state of Pennsylvania. The casino’s Director of Online Gaming, Joe Lupo, said that the new game was designed to appeal to both experienced and beginner players alike.

Baccarat is a simple card game that typically involves two cards being dealt to each player and the banker. The aim of the game is to reach a total as close to nine as possible, with any number over nine counting as ten. Aces are worth one point and other cards their face value.

In online baccarat, each player is dealt two cards and the banker one. If either player has an eight or nine they automatically win, otherwise the hands are compared and the highest total wins. If both totals are equal, it is known as a ‘push’ and no money changes hands.

Lupo said that Rivers Casino Pittsburgh’s online baccarat offering differs from most in that players are able to bet on either the player or banker hand, or alternatively on a tie. He added that this gave players more control over their destiny and allowed for some interesting betting possibilities.

The new game can be played on desktop or mobile devices using either real money or play money.
