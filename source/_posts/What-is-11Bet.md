#  What is Olympique Lyonnais?

Olympique Lyonnais, also known simply as Lyon, is a French professional football club based in Lyon. The club was formed in 1899 and currently plays in Ligue 1, the top tier of French football. Lyon has won the Coupe de France seven times and the Ligue 1 championship on six occasions.

The club's home ground is the Stade de Gerland, which replaced the Stade Olympique de Lyon in 2001. Lyon has a large fan base, with over 270,000 members as of 2016–17.

Olympique Lyonnais is one of the most successful clubs in French football history, having won the Coupe de France on seven occasions (the joint-third most), the Ligue 1 championship six times (the fourth most) and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League twice (in 2003–04 and 2004–05). The clubs honours also include two Intertoto Cups (1999 and 2000) and a European Cup Winners' Cup (2000).

Lyon was founded as a football club in 1899 by Jean-Baptiste Poujol, Emmanuel Fraissinet and Ludovic Comte, who were students at engineering school École Centrale de Lyon. The club's name was derived from the city's nickname for its residents—Les Gones—and came from Olimpia Club of Italy, which shared its colors of red and white. Olimpia Club merged with Stade Olympique Lyonnais three years later to form Football Club Lyon.

In 1902, Lyon moved to play at the Stade des Iris, which they would call home for 71 years. In 1937, FC Lyon joined the regional league Rhône-Alpes. In 1945, they were crowned champions following a 3–2 victory against CA Paris-Saint-Germain II at Parc des Princes; this was their first championship win. They would go on to win their second title in 1947 after defeating La Seyne sur Mer 3–1 . In 1949, FC Lyon changed its name to Olympique Lyonnais . In 1954, they captured their third title after defeating AS Cannes 3–2 once again at Parc des Princes. Between 1956 and 1968—a period that saw Les Gones finish runners-up twice—OL never managed to take home the trophy despite consistently challenging for it each season; this led some supporters to nickname them "champions of hearts". 

In 1973 OL began playing at their current home ground, the Stade de Gerland. The following year saw them reach new heights by winning their first ever cup competition: Coupe de France . They defeated SC Bastia 2–1 in what was only their second appearance in it final overall (the first being in 1971 when they lost to FC Nantes). After another titleless decade Post-World War II , Olympique Lyonnais reached their zenith by becoming French champions for a fifth time in 1981; narrowly edging out PSG thanks to goals scored by Bernard Lacombe and Sonny Anderson over both legs of their playoff match up following a draw away at Parc des Princes. 1982 brought more cup glory as OL lifted Coupe de la Ligue trophy for first time ever after defeating Bastia once again , this time 2–1 with goals from Daniel Bravo and Safet Sušić; adding another chapter to what is now known as Derby du Rhône rivalry with Bastia who are based just 113 km away from Lyon on Corsica island .

After several below par seasons Les Gones bounced back by winning both league cup competitions back-to-back in 2006 & 2007 ; becoming only seventh team ever to do so within same calendar year . They did so under controversial circumstances though as many titles were stripped from then dominating side AC Monaco due financial irregularities committed during season 2005/06 — leaving Olympique Lyonnais as rightful Ligue 1 champions .2007 incarnation of OL featured high scoring Brazilian international Fred who netted 16 goals during campaign before transferring midway through season to English Premier League side Fluminense ; breaking all sorts of records along way becoming most expensive player ever sold by an French club . Since his departure no other player has come close to replicating his goal scoring feats for Saint Étienne manager Loïc Perrin even going so far as stating that "Fred was unique" . 

2011 marked start of difficult period for Les Gones as they went trophyless for next four seasons making it longest such streak since late 1970s; period often referred as "Dark Age" by supporters . Things started looking up again around end 2015 when Bruno Genesio was appointed head coach taking team into Europa League semifinals during his first full season 2017/18 edition proved to be successful one altogether ; winning Coupe de France while reaching semi finals of Europa League yet again losing narrowly 5:4 on aggregate against Spanish side Atl
