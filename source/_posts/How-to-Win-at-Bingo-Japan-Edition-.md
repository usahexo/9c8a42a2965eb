# How to Win at Bingo: Japan Edition 

In Japan, bingo is enjoyed as both a casual pastime and a competitive sport. While the game may seem simple enough, there are a few tricks to playing (and winning) at bingo that can give you an edge over the competition. 

The first is to take advantage of the different ways to mark your cards. There are a variety of different ways to do this, but one popular method is to use different colors for each column. This makes it easy to keep track of which numbers have been called and helps ensure you don’t miss any possibilities. 

Another key strategy is to pay attention to the patterns that tend to form. In Japan, there are often specialized patterns that emerge which can give players an advantage. Learning these patterns and keeping track of them can help you snag that winning bingo! 

Finally, make sure you’re keeping an eye on your opponents. Bingo can be a very social game, and it’s not uncommon for players to chat with each other while they play. By paying attention to what others are doing – and more importantly, what they’re not doing – you may be able to get an edge on the competition. 

So, now that you know how to play Japanese bingo like a pro, what are you waiting for? Get out there and start winning!

# Bingo cash jackpots in Japan reaching new heights 

The popularity of bingo in Japan has been growing rapidly in recent years, due in part to the big cash jackpots that are up for grabs. In March 2018, a whopping ¥7.5 billion (approx. $68 million) was awarded to a single lucky winner – the largest prize ever given out in Japan’s history of bingo.

This trend looks set to continue in the near future, with new and bigger jackpots being announced all the time. For example, the popular chain Fuji Grand recently revealed that it is offering a colossal ¥10 billion (approx. $90 million) prize for its next major tournament. That’s more than enough to get even the most casual player excited!

So what’s behind this surge in bingo jackpots? The answer is simple: competition between operators has driven them to offer ever-bigger sums of money, in an attempt to attract more players. And it seems to be working, as people from all walks of life are getting involved in this exciting form of gambling.

Some might say that it’s only a matter of time until an even bigger prize is won, and that could well prove to be true. So if you’re feeling lucky, why not give bingo a go? There’s never been a better time to start playing, and you could be the next big winner!

# Winning at bingo in Japan – some top tips!

Bingo in Japan is a hugely popular game, and if you want to be a winner, you need to know the ropes! So read on for our top tips on how to beat the competition and come out on top.

1. Familiarize yourself with the bingo lingo

There are some specific terms that you need to know when playing bingo in Japan. The most important ones are “bingo” (正解 or せいかい), which is what you say when you have matched all of the numbers on your card, and “daisuki” (大好き or だいすき), which is Japanese for “I love it” and is what you say when you get a bingo. Other key terms include “hanamichi” (花道), which is the aisle down the middle of the bingo hall where players walk to collect their winnings, and “otsukare” (お疲れ or おつかれ), which means “well done” and is what players say to one another when someone gets a bingo.

2. Arrive early

The best way to increase your chances of winning at bingo in Japan is to arrive early and get yourself a good seat. This will give you plenty of time to study the cards and pick out any potential winning patterns. It also means that you’ll be one of the first players called up when the game starts, giving you an advantage over your competitors.

3. Use your dauber wisely

Your dauber is an important tool when playing bingo in Japan, so make sure you use it wisely! Try not to waste time daubing each number as it’s called, as this can slow down the game and give your opponents an advantage. Instead, focus on the numbers that are most likely to form part of a winning pattern, and save daubing for later rounds when there are fewer numbers left to call.

4. Stay focused

Bingo can be a lot of fun, but it’s important not to get distracted if you want to win! Make sure you keep an eye on the numbers being called and stay alert so that you don’t miss any opportunities. And if someone else gets a bingo before you do, don’t get discouraged – just keep playing and stay focused on winning yourself!
