#  Pistons Win Record $27 Million Jackpot from Mega Millions!

On Tuesday, the Mega Millions Jackpot was won by a ticket sold in Michigan. The lucky winner matched all six numbers drawn - 5, 28, 62, 65, 70 and the Mega Ball of 5. This is the third largest jackpot in the game's history and it came just in time for the Pistons who were in desperate need of a financial boost.

The Pistons organization has been struggling for some time now and this mega jackpot win comes as a much-needed relief. In fact, team owner Tom Gores had even threatened to move the team if they didn't start turning things around soon. With this $27 million windfall however, it's likely that the Pistons will be sticking around for a while longer.

In addition to the financial benefits, this win should also give the team a morale boost. After all, no one likes to feel like they're losing all the time and with this big win, the Pistons can finally start feeling like they're on top of the world.

There's no telling how this money will change things for the Pistons but we can be sure that it will make a big difference. Congratulations to the Michigan Lottery and to the Detroit Pistons on this amazing win!

#  Where Does Detroit Pistons Winner Put His Winnings?

In 1998, the Detroit Pistons won the National Basketball Association Championship. Each player on the team received a championship ring and a share of the $3 million prize money. Where did that money go?

The players each received a check for $167,000. Most of the players invested their winnings in stocks, real estate, and businesses. Some of the players gave portions of their winnings to charity. Chauncey Billups, who was drafted by the Pistons in 1997 and was a key player on the championship team, donated $100,000 to his former high school.

Some of the players spent their winnings on luxury items. Grant Hill, who was traded to the Orlando Magic in 1999, spent $4.5 million on a home in Florida. Richard Hamilton bought a Rolls-Royce and two Mercedes Benzes. Jerry Stackhouse bought a 10,000 square-foot home with seven bedrooms and nine bathrooms.

There is no record of where Karl Malone put his winnings after he won his first championship with the Utah Jazz in 1998. However, he may have followed in the footsteps of most NBA players and invested his winnings in stocks or real estate.

#  Pistons Fans Hit Jackpot with Team's Huge Wins

The Detroit Pistons have put together an impressive start to the season, and their fans are already reaping the benefits.

The Pistons currently sit atop the Central Division with a 14-7 record and are looking like one of the most improved teams in the league. What's even more impressive is that they've done this without their best player, Blake Griffin, who has been sidelined with a knee injury.

Griffin is expected to return to the lineup soon, and when he does, the Pistons will be even more of a force to be reckoned with. This has fans in Detroit excited about what's to come for their team.

One fan said: "I never thought I'd see the day where the Pistons were this good. We're on our way to being a championship team."

Another fan said: "I'm so glad we got rid of Stan Van Gundy and brought in Dwane Casey. He's turning this team around."

Whatever happens for the Pistons in the rest of the season, their fans can be sure of one thing: they've hit the jackpot with this team's huge wins.
